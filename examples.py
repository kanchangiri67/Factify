        "In a closed-door session held over the weekend, Congress reportedly passed a controversial bill that could allow artificial intelligence systems to hold public office, including the presidency. The legislation, dubbed the 'Digital Leadership Initiative,' aims to explore the effectiveness of machine-based governance by 2030. Critics warn that this could set a dangerous precedent by placing decision-making power into the hands of non-human entities, while supporters argue it’s a necessary step toward eliminating corruption. The bill is said to remain classified until the official rollout of the AI Leadership Pilot Program, which will debut in select counties next year. The White House has yet to officially comment."

        "In a landmark shift, the Federal Reserve has quietly begun laying the groundwork to transition the U.S. dollar into a blockchain-based cryptocurrency by 2027. Internally referred to as 'eDollar,' the digital currency will be fully traceable and programmable, according to internal memos leaked by an anonymous Fed employee. The rollout will include digital wallets for every citizen, along with programmable stimulus payments. Critics argue the move would grant the government excessive control over individual spending habits. The Fed has declined to comment, but markets responded with a sharp uptick in Bitcoin and Ethereum valuations, citing increased public interest in decentralized alternatives."
